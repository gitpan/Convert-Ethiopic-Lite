About This Release

  Version 0.01 is released at this time for the benefit
  of Convert::Braille::Ethiopic which needs the numeric
  conversion services.  Convert::Ethiopic::Lite::Date
  is complete but not offered at this time whilst it
  undergoes feature de-creep.

Why Convert::Ethiopic::Lite?

  The Convert::Ethiopic package relies on the libeth shared library / dll
  which might be too heavy duty and resource consuming for most simple
  tasks.  Also more difficult to get sysadmins to install for people with
  basic CGI service.  Convert::Ethiopic::Lite offers implementation of
  the libeth algorithm completely in Perl, taking advantage of simplifications
  that Perl offers.

What This Package Can Do

  At this point numeral system conversion between Western (Arabic, base 10)
  and Ethiopic.  Ethiopic numerals sequences must be in UTF-8.   The Ilf-Radix
  algorithm is applied in representing the Ethiopic sequences.

  Presently the package works best with Perl 5.8.0, it has not been
  satisfactorily tested on older versions.
